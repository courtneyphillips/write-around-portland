Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?
39 commits, excellent work, super descriptive. You are overachievers. Alas,
 there is no readme for instructions on how to set up the app.

Is there good spec coverage?

7 specs passing. That's 2 more than ours. Excellent job. Great coverage.


Do all specs pass?

7 specs passing. Excellent

Is the application logic clear and easy to navigate?

The site is very easy to navigate and beautifully designed.
Excellent use of the bootstrap.


Can you make a test payment through Stripe?

First time through the site broke but the second time it worked like
a charm. Superior execution. We chalk up the first breakage to operator
error.


Is the site user-friendly?

The site is not only user-friendly but very pleasing to the eye.
The colors are bright and the icons are large for we older users.

Are there opportunities for refactoring?

The code looks lean and elegant. We don't see an opportunities for
refactoring.


What features stand out?

We really liked the e-store and the writers page, especially the latter.
Really appreciated the timeline. Very visual.


What features could be improved?

Aside from content being added to the "Who We Are", "What We Do", "What You Can Do",
which we assume will be added in later iterations, the features are superb.


Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?

A beautiful site, well-executed. We prefer it to the original. With that said,
we would've appreciated a README and use of simple cov but those are minor
quibbles for such a stunning site. Kudos on such a great job. Well done.
